  <p>I love working with projects that help me understand what users like best and what people don’t like or prefer. 

Something personal about me is that if I don’t satisfy other people needs from my UI work and research, I won’t stop trying to find a solution out of it until I do. 

Doing research, is one of the most important and interesting things in this job field because I get to experience users minds and how they work using the internet. This allows me to get useful information for users to have a better experience using the product for the company
